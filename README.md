## Projects
- [Connect Four](https://absolam.github.io/Connect-Four-Game/): A connect four game where you can play against a computer or another player! There is a 30 second timer and a point tracker for each game won. The pieces are animated to fall into place and change color according to the player's turn.
- [Invoice App](https://absolam.github.io/invoice-react/): Responsive, front-end invoicing app, where you can create invoices that contain the
information of both parties and the items being billed. You can view previous invoices,
mark if they are paid, or delete them. There is also light and dark mode that will save
your preference. 
- [Memory Game](https://absolam.github.io/Memory-Game/): A game created with React where you are tasked with finding matching pairs. You can choose to play solo or with up to four players. There are also options of using icons instead of numbers and increasing the difficulty from a 4x4 grid to 6x6. The time and number of moves are tracked for each game.
